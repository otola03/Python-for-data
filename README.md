# Google Advanced Data Analytics 
This is where I keep my codes (notebooks) that were used when taking the course on Coursera.   
The notebooks are downloaded via Coursera.

## Course Overview
In this course, I learn 
- Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Create data visualizations
- Apply statistical methods to investigate data
- Build regression models and ML models to predict data
- Communicate insights



## Why this course ?
I am currently a student in Stony Brook University, Computer Science.  
After finsihing my military service, I became more and more intrigued to the power of data.
The first time I was interested in statistics and its applied use to data is when I started watching motorsports, like Formula One (F1).
Motorsports, including F1, utilize the power of statistics and data to develop cars, make decisions, increase performance, and come up with strategies. 
ML models and regression analysis plays a key role here.  
By completing this course, I hope to equip fundamental skills of Python and be able to employ ML models and other statistical models to predict and analyze data.
